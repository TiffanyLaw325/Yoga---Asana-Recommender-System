The liver, abdominal organs and muscles are massag-\n","ed. The pancreas and adrenal glands are toned, balancing\n","\n","their secretions. The kidneys are massaged and excess\n","weight is reduced around the abdominal area.\n","This leads to improved functioning of the digestive,\n","excretory and reproductive organs and helps to remove\n","gastrointestinal disorders, dyspepsia, chronic constipation\n","and sluggishness of the liver.\n","It is useful for the management of diabetes and menstrual\n","disorders.
